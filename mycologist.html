 Dr. Mary Whetstone was a physician in the late 1800s in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She worked for women’s sufferage, and was a founder and the first president of the Minnesota Mycological Society. How did a doctor who broke the glass ceiling develop a passion for mushrooms?

    <blockquote>The Women’s Club of Minneapolis met in regular session Wednesday evening, March 27th, in the medical library rooms. The
    paper of the evening was by Dr. Mary S. Whetstone, entitled, <i>“Foods and Their Value.”</i> It was a scientific presentation
    of the chief foods upon which we rely for sustenance; the relative proportion of food principles which each contains,
    and their value in forming a correct diet/ Discussion followed and was closed by Dr. Whetstone.

    <p>As a Mycologist
    The Minnesota Mycological Society is the second oldest mycological society in North America. It was founded in 1898 on
    the initiative of Mary S. Whetstone, a prominent Minneapolis physician. The society was incorporated in 1899, and it has
    been in continuous existence since then. Mary Whetstone corresponded with nationally known mycologists of her time
    seeking their help in identification. Today her collections can still be found at the New York State Museum in Albany
    and as a part of the C.G. Lloyd Collection (National Fungus Collection).

    Dr. Mary Whetstone was the person for whom Peck proposed the name (with masculine ending however) on a herbarium label
    at the New York State Museum mycological herbarium in Albany very near the end of his life.
