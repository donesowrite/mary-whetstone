                    Dr. Mary Whetstone was a physician in the late 1800s in Minneapolis, Minnesota. She worked for
                    women&#39;s sufferage, and was a founder and the first president of the Minnesota Mycological
                    Society. How did a doctor who broke the glass ceiling develop a passion for mushrooms?

                    the medical library rooms. The
                    paper of the evening was by Dr. Mary S. Whetstone, entitled, <i>“Foods and Their Value.”</i> It was
                    a scientific presentation
                    of the chief foods upon which we rely for sustenance; the relative proportion of food principles
                    which each contains,
                    and their value in forming a correct diet/ Discussion followed and was closed by Dr. Whetstone.

                    The Minnesota Mycological Society is the second oldest mycological society in North America. It was
                    founded in 1898 on
                    the initiative of Mary S. Whetstone, a prominent Minneapolis physician. The society was incorporated
                    in 1899, and it has
                    been in continuous existence since then. Mary Whetstone corresponded with nationally known
                    mycologists of her time
                    seeking their help in identification. Today her collections can still be found at the New York State
                    Museum in Albany
                    and as a part of the C.G. Lloyd Collection (National Fungus Collection).

                <p>Charles Peck, 1833–1917, was a leading American mycologist from 1868 until 1913. During this time,
                    American mycology was experiencing a surge of growth thanks to intense work on the descriptive
                    taxonomy of fungi.
                </p>
                <p>Peck, who was
                    self-taught in mycology was given a position as botanist at the New York State Museum in 1868. He
                    worked there until he had a debilitating stroke in 1913, just prior to
                    his 80th birthday. During his career, Dr. Peck described more
                    than 2,700 new species and varieties of North American fungi.

                    It was during Dr. Peck's later years at the New York State Museum that Mary Whetstone, now the
                    founder and President of the Minnesota Myological Society, first wrote to him.

                    In a letter dated November 3rd, 1998, she refers to the group as the, “Minneapolis Mycological
                    Club.” She goes on to say, “We have about 20 enthusiastic, intelligent members.”
                    Mary was writing to ask for help with some of the more difficult identifications they encountered as
                    a group.

                <p>
                    Dr. Peck soon became, informally, what would today be called a Scientific Advisor to the MMS. In
                    return, the MMS sent Dr. Peck many interesting specimens of fungi to study.

                    Near the end of his life, Dr. Peck honored Dr. Mary Whetstone by naming the mushroom Amanita
                    <i>whetstoneae</i> after her
                    at the New York State Museum mycological herbarium in Albany.
