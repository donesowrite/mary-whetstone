      One of the Most Remarkable Women in Minnesota's History
    </h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Mary Whetstone did many things throughout her lifetime that would merit recognition and acclaim, yet there is
      little information about her in books or on the internet. Having done my own research, I wish to share her story
      and the impact she has made on Minnesota's medical system and the field of mycology.
