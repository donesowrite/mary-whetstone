        <p>
          Dr. Mary Whetstone did many things throughout her lifetime that would merit recognition and acclaim, yet there
          is
          little information about her in books or on the internet. Having done my own research, I wish to share her
          story
          and the impact she has made on Minnesota&#39;s medical system and the field of mycology.
