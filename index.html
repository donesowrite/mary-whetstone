    <h2>
      One of the Most Remarkable Women in Minnesota's History
    </h2>

    <p>
      Dr. Mary Whetstone did many things throughout her lifetime that would merit recognition and acclaim, yet it is
      very difficult to find information about her in books or on the internet. Having done my own research, I wish to
      share her story and the impact she has made on Minnesota's medical system and the field of mycology.
      <br><br>
      Born August 24, 1849, Mary Snoddy got her degree from the University of Michigan in 1881. Her husband, Alan S.
      Whetstone
      got his degree from the University of Michigan in 1880. He preceded Mary in death by 20 years on April 19, 1909.
      Mary died
      of pneumonia in her home, at the age of 80 on October 24, 1929. At the time of her death, Mary was the
      corresponding secretary of the Minnesota Mycological Society.

        One source lists Mary's death as May 7, 1929.
