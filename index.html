        <p>
          Dr. Mary Whetstone did many things throughout her lifetime that would merit recognition and acclaim, yet there
          is
          little information about her in books or on the internet. Having done my own research, I wish to share her
          story
          and the impact she has made on Minnesota&#39;s medical system and the field of mycology.

        <h2>Mary Becomes a Doctor</h2>

        <p>Mary Snoddy was born in Pennsylvania (Dauphin County) on August 24, 1849. She grew up attending public
          schools and then went to Female College in Granville, Ohio. In 1881, Mary got her degree from the University
          of Michigan. She attended vsrious clinics, in London, Paris, Vienna, Detroit, Boston, and New York.
          <br><br>
          She then served on the staff of the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston, Massachusetts.
          The Hospital's goal was to educate women in the study of medicine and
          train nurses to care for the sick. In this way, they could provide patients with competent female physicians.
          No doubt, this would leave a deep impression on Mary and set her on a course to continue to use her medical
          training for the good of the women and children in the community in which she lived. Soon, Minneapolis,
          Minnesota would be the beneficiary of her energy and skill.
          <br><br>
          In June on 1882, Mary and Dr. Allen S. Whetstone of Marshalltown, Iowa were married. He had attended the
          University of Michigan, as well, graduating a year ahead of Mary. They moved to Minneapolis where they lived
          out the rest of their lives.



          He preceded Mary in death by 20
          years on April 19, 1909.

          Mary died of pneumonia in her home, at the age of 80 on October 24, 1929. At the time of her death, Mary
          was the corresponding secretary of the Minnesota Mycological Society.</p>
