            Minneapolis, Minnesota's 2nd Female Physician
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1890, when Mary arrived in Minneapolis, Minnesota, she was the second woman doctor in the city. She was part
            of the pediatric medical staff at the Asbury Hospital when it opened in 1892.
        <p>
            Asbury Methodist Hospital, founded in Minneapolis, MN in 1892 with 32 beds. In
            1952, the hospital would relocate to St. Louis Park, MN and become the Methodist Hospital. Today, it is Park
            Nicolet
            Methodist.

            The Walkers: One of Minnesota's Power Couples
        </h2>
        Thomas Barlow Walker was an American business magnate who acquired lumber in Minnesota and California. By 1923, he
        was among the ten wealthiest men in the world. He also became a prominent art collector founding the Walker Art
        Center as well as the Minneapolis Public Library. Thomas lived in Minneapolis with and his wife, Harriet, and their
        8 children.
        <br><br>
        <p>Harriet Granger Walker was a powerful woman in her own right.
            She was
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>President of Northwestern Hospital from 1862 to 1917</li>
            <li>President of the Bethany Home, known today as the Walker Methodist Home</li>
            <li>Member of the Women's Council of the City of Minneapolis</li>
            <li>Member of the Hennepin Avenue Methodist Church</li>
            <li>Member of the Nonpartisan National Women's Christian Temperance Union</li>
            <li>Member ofthe Minneapolis Association Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to Women</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        Harriet had a lot of connections, and she knew how to use them. In November 1882, she invited her circle of friends,
        including Dr. Mary Whetstone to listen to Dr. Mary Hood speak on the problems of the poor and their lack of health
        care.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        As Dr. Hood told one story after another of children suffering from malnutrition, diphtheria, and tuberculosis, Dr.
        Mary Whetstone chimed in. Far too many women were dying as well, from typhoid and pneumonia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Walker decided that these women could come up with the money to build a charity hospital for the poorest
            women and children in Minneapolis. And thatâ€™s exactly what they did.

        <h2>
            Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children
        </h2>
        <p>
            One month later, the Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children opened in a rented house on Three and a Half
            Avenue South. Within a year, they put a down-payment on a bigger house and filed articles of incorporation. By
            1887 the hospital had built a permanent home on the corner of Chicago and 27th Street with Doctors Hood and
            Whetstone as the hospital's physicians.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hood and Whetstone used diet, cleanliness, and rest to cure their patients. According to Dr. Hood, </p>
        <blockquote>"...we depend largely
            upon nursing to sustain the vital forces...and so help nature to gain the victory. In many severe cases our good
            nursing
            has come to the rescue; frequent bathing and clean linen, good nourishing food given regularly, and the quiet
            rest
            induced by the confidence of good care are the secrets of our successful issues."</blockquote>
        <p>This was often enough to help these
            tired, poor, half-starved women and children, to recuperate from whatever illness they had.</p>
        <p>
            Today, Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children is Abbott Northwestern Hospital of Allina Health.
