                    In 1890, when Mary arrived in Minneapolis, Minnesota, she was the second woman doctor in the city.
                    She
                    was part
                    of the pediatric medical staff at the Asbury Hospital when it opened in 1892.

                    Thomas Barlow Walker was an American business magnate who acquired lumber in Minnesota and
                    California.
                    By 1923, he
                    was among the ten wealthiest men in the world. He also became a prominent art collector founding <a

                    Harriet Had A Lot of Connections, and She Knew How to Use Them.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    In November 1882, she invited her circle of
                    friends, including Dr. Mary Whetstone to listen to Dr. Mary Hood speak on the problems of the poor
                    and their
                    lack of health care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Dr. Hood told one story after another of children suffering from malnutrition, diphtheria, and
                    tuberculosis, Dr. Mary Whetstone chimed in. Far too many women were dying as well, from typhoid and
                    pneumonia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Walker decided that these women could come up with the money to build a charity hospital for
                    the
                    poorest
                    women and children in Minneapolis. And that&#39;s exactly what they did.

                    Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One month later, the Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children opened in a rented house on Three
                    and
                    a Half Avenue South. Within a year, they put a down-payment on a bigger house and filed articles of
                    incorporation. By 1887 the hospital had built a permanent home on the corner of Chicago and 27th
                    Street
                    with Doctors Hood
                    and Whetstone as the hospital's physicians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hood and Whetstone used diet, cleanliness, and rest to cure their patients. According to Dr. Hood,
                </p>
                <blockquote>"...we depend largely
                    upon nursing to sustain the vital forces...and so help nature to gain the victory. In many severe
                    cases
                    our good
                    nursing
                    has come to the rescue; frequent bathing and clean linen, good nourishing food given regularly, and
                    the
                    quiet
                    rest
                    induced by the confidence of good care are the secrets of our successful issues."</blockquote>
                <p>This was often enough to help these
                    tired, poor, half-starved women and children, to recuperate from whatever illness they had.

                    Part of the Women&#39;s Movement
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When Drs. Whetstone and Hood founded and served as administrators of the Northwestern Hospital for
                    Women and
                    Children in
                    Minneapolis in 1882, they were just the beginning of a movement. By the 1890s there were 68 women
                    doctors
                    registered in
                    the state of Minnesota. Women could also be found practicing law, as clergy, and as educators in
                    ever
                    growing numbers.
                    There were even 43 county superintendents. Even though the number of professionals was growing, the
                    inequality remained. The 2, 306 male teachers in Minnesota averaged a monthly salary of $46, while
                    the 9,
                    811 female teachers earned only $38.
