            In 1890, when Mary arrived in Minneapolis, Minnesota, she was the second woman doctor in the city. She
            was part
            of the pediatric medical staff at the Asbury Hospital when it opened in 1892.

            Asbury Methodist Hospital, founded in Minneapolis, MN in 1892 with 32 beds. In
            1952, the hospital would relocate to St. Louis Park, MN and become <a href="https://www.healthpartners.com/care/hospitals/methodist/about/">Methodist Hospital</a>.

        <h3>
            Harriet Had A Lot of Connections, and She Knew How to Use Them.
        </h3>
        <p>
            In November 1882, she invited her circle of
            friends, including Dr. Mary Whetstone to listen to Dr. Mary Hood speak on the problems of the poor and their
            lack of health care.
        </p>
        <p>
            As Dr. Hood told one story after another of children suffering from malnutrition, diphtheria, and
            tuberculosis, Dr. Mary Whetstone chimed in. Far too many women were dying as well, from typhoid and
            pneumonia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mrs. Walker decided that these women could come up with the money to build a charity hospital for the
            poorest
            women and children in Minneapolis. And thatâ€™s exactly what they did.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children
        </h2>
        <p>
            One month later, the Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children opened in a rented house on Three and
            a Half Avenue South. Within a year, they put a down-payment on a bigger house and filed articles of
            incorporation. By 1887 the hospital had built a permanent home on the corner of Chicago and 27th Street
            with Doctors Hood
            and Whetstone as the hospital's physicians.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hood and Whetstone used diet, cleanliness, and rest to cure their patients. According to Dr. Hood, </p>
        <blockquote>"...we depend largely
            upon nursing to sustain the vital forces...and so help nature to gain the victory. In many severe cases
            our good
            nursing
            has come to the rescue; frequent bathing and clean linen, good nourishing food given regularly, and the
            quiet
            rest
            induced by the confidence of good care are the secrets of our successful issues."</blockquote>
        <p>This was often enough to help these
            tired, poor, half-starved women and children, to recuperate from whatever illness they had.</p>
        <p>
            Today, Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children is <a href="https://www.allinahealth.org/abbott-northwestern-hospital/about-us/hospital-overview">Abbott Northwestern Hospital of Allina Health.</a>

        <h2>
            Part of the Women's Movement
        </h2>
        <p>
When Drs. Whetstone and Hood founded and served as administrators of the Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children in
Minneapolis in 1882, they were just the beginning of a movement. By the 1890s there were 68 women doctors registered in
the state of Minnesota. Women could also be found practicing law, as clergy, and as educators in ever growing numbers.
There were even 43 county superintendents. Even though the number of professionals was growing, the inequality remained. The 2, 306 male teachers in Minnesota averaged a monthly salary of $46, while the 9, 811 female teachers earned only $38.
